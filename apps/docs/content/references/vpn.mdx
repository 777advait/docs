title: How to connect to Zerops VPN
---

To start the VPN you need first [install & setup zCLI](/references/cli), the Zerops command-line tool.

## Start the VPN
Use `zcli vpn start` command to start a VPN session to the selected project.

```sh
Usage:
  zcli vpn start [projectNameOrId] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help        Displays help for the vpn start command.
      --mtu <int>   Sets a custom MTU for VPN interface. Default value is 1420.
```

You must enclose the project name in quotes if it contains a space. The project name is visible in Zerops GUI. If you have more projects with a duplicate name, use the project ID instead. You'll find the project ID in the URL of the project dashboard page in Zerops GUI. <br/>E.g. <code>https://app&#46;zerops.io/project/<b>Evs8Je4NTvKeIkUqoUXp2w</b>/service-stacks</code>.

:::info 
When you run the `zcli vpn start` command for the first time, you will be asked if you want to install the Zerops VPN daemon to your computer. Confirm the installation by entering `y`. Then zCLI prompts for your root/administrator password to your computer.
:::

The zCLI starts a VPN session in the selected Zerops project. You can't be connected to multiple projects at the same time. If an existing VPN connection to another project is active, it will be stopped automatically and a new VPN connection will be opened.

Once the VPN session is established, you have the secured connection to the project's private network in Zerops. You can access all project services locally by using their hostname. The only difference is that no [environment variables](/features/env-variables) are available when connected through VPN. 

Zerops VPN daemon keeps the VPN connection open during the whole VPN session until you stop it. If the connection is lost, the daemon tries to restore the connection automatically.

## Stop the VPN
Use `zcli vpn stop` command to stop the existing VPN session.

```sh
Usage:
  zcli vpn stop [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   Displays help for the vpn stop command.
```
