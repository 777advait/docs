description: Detailed pricing description for deployment on zerops.
---

Zerops offers a usage based pricing model which can accommodate any **small-scale** or **high-availability** applications.

## Projects

A [project](/features/infrastructure#project) is the internal **infrastructure**, dedicated for your **services**. Think of it as a private network where you can deploy your services inside and interact with each other.

You need a project even if you plan on spinning up a single small node.js service, as this internal infrastructure is what allows most of the functionalities on Zerops.

Zerops offers two project core packages:

### Lightweight project core package (Less RAM and CPU usage)

- Core services (L3 balancer with firewall, logger, statistics), HTTP routing and load balancers all on single container
- Proxy / Load balancer
- Unique IPv6 address
- 15 hours of build time
- 5 GB space for automated backups
- 100 GB of egress

### Serious project core package (Highly available setup)

- Highly available core services (L3 balancer with firewall, logger, statistics)
- Highly available HTTP routing & load balancer
- Proxy / Load balancer
- Unique IPv6 address
- 150 hours of build time
- 25 GB space for automated backups
- 3 TB of egress

:::info
Project core is refundable, for eg. if you create a serious project, pay $10 and then delete it after 15 days, you'll get $5 back
:::

## Resources & Costs

The pricing model is based on the amount of resources allocated to your services inside a project.

:::info
Pricing is minute based, but credit is deducted once per hour based on the usage throughout the hour.
