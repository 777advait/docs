title: Update internal ports
---

## Zerops GUI
To update PHP internal ports, go to your service detail page and choose **Public access & internal ports** in the main menu. There you can edit or remove current ports or add new ones.

// TODO screenshot
(change internal ports)

Each internal port has following parameters:

1. **TCP** or **UDP** protocol
2. Check **HTTP protocol support** if a web server runs on the port. Zerops uses this information for the configuration of [external routing]. *This option is available only in combination with the **TCP** protocol.*
3. The **port number**. The port number must be set between 10 and 65435. Ports outside this interval are reserved for internal Zerops systems.

If the PHP service has the Zerops subdomain enabled, the list of subdomains will be updated automatically to correspond with the new set of internal ports.

If you delete an internal port that has been used in the [public port routing], Zerops will also delete all configurations that used the deleted port as a destination.

:::note
Zerops doesn't restart your service after the internal ports have changed. Restart your service manually or perform a [new deploy](/php/how-to/trigger-pipeline) if needed.
