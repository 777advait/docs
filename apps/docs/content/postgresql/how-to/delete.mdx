## Delete PostgreSQL service in Zerops GUI
Go to the project dashboard and select the **delete service** menu item in the top right corner.

**// TODO screenshot (show menu with the delete service item)**

## Delete PostgreSQL using zCLI
zCLI is the Zerops command-line tool. To delete the PostgreSQL service via the command-line, follow these steps:
1. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli)
2. Run the `zcli service delete` command  

```sh
Deletes the Zerops service.

Usage:
  zcli service delete [projectNameOrId] [serviceName] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help      Displays help for the service delete command.


      --confirm   If set, zCLI will not ask for confirmation. 
```

You must enclose the `projectNameOrId` in quotes if it contains a space. The project name is visible in Zerops GUI. If you have more projects with a duplicate name, use the project ID instead. You'll find the project ID in the URL of the project dashboard page in Zerops GUI. <br/>E.g. <code>https://app&#46;zerops.io/project/<b>Evs8Je4NTvKeIkUqoUXp2w</b>/service-stacks</code>.
