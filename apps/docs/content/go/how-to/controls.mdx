title: Stop and start Go service
---

Zerops allows you to stop any service. Stopped services only consume disk.

## Stop and start Go service in Zerops GUI
To stop the Go service in Zerops GUI go to the project dashboard and select the stop menu item in the top right corner.

**// TODO screenshot (show menu with the start and stop items on a service)**

To start the stopped Go service choose the **start** item from the same menu.

## Stop and start Go using zCLI
zCLI is the Zerops command-line tool. To stop and start the Go service via the command-line, follow these steps:
1. [Install & setup zCLI](/references/cli)
2. Run the `zcli service stop` command  

```sh
Stops the Zerops service.

Usage:
  zcli service stop [projectNameOrId] [serviceName] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   Displays help for the service stop command.
```
You must enclose the `projectNameOrId` in quotes if it contains a space. The project name is visible in Zerops GUI. If you have more projects with a duplicate name, use the project ID instead. You'll find the project ID in the URL of the project dashboard page in Zerops GUI. <br/>E.g. <code>https://app&#46;zerops.io/project/<b>Evs8Je4NTvKeIkUqoUXp2w</b>/service-stacks</code>.

3. Run the `zcli service start` command  
```sh
Starts the Zerops service.

Usage:
  zcli service start [projectNameOrId] [serviceName] [flags]

Flags:
  -h, --help   Displays help for the service start command.
```
